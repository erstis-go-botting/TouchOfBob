###### Scaling-ninja wird erwachsen. 

Der Bot wird vollständig neu geschrieben aus mehreren Gründen.
Diese beinhalten unter anderem das Erweitern des Verständnisses des Codes
bei allen Authoren. Aber auch um gewisse Funktionalitäten schneller und besser 
(besser = sauberer, python-zen konform) umsetzen zu können.


###### Learning by doing:

###### From learnpythonthehardway.org:
>In the fairy tales about heroes defeating evil villains there's always a dark forest of some kind.
>It could be a cave, a forest, another planet, just some place that everyone knows the hero shouldn't go.
>Of course, shortly after the villain is introduced you find out, yes, the hero has to go to that stupid forest to kill the bad guy.
>It seems the hero just keeps getting into situations that require him to risk his life in this evil forest.

>You rarely read fairy tales about the heroes who are smart enough to just avoid the whole situation entirely.
>You never hear a hero say, "Wait a minute, if I leave to make my fortunes on the high seas leaving Buttercup behind
>I could die and then she'd have to marry some ugly prince named Humperdink. Humperdink!
>I think I'll stay here and start a Farm Boy for Rent business." If he did that there'd be no fire swamp,
>dying, reanimation, sword fights, giants, or any kind of story really. Because of this, the forest in these stories
>seems to exist like a black hole that drags the hero in no matter what they do.

>In object-oriented programming, Inheritance is the evil forest. Experienced programmers know to avoid this evil
>because they know that deep inside the Dark Forest Inheritance is the Evil Queen Multiple Inheritance.
>She likes to eat software and programmers with her massive complexity teeth, chewing on the flesh of the fallen.
>But the forest is so powerful and so tempting that nearly every programmer has to go into it, and try to make it out alive with
>the Evil Queen's head before they can call themselves real programmers. You just can't resist the Inheritance Forest's pull, so you go in.
>After the adventure you learn to just stay out of that stupid forest and bring an army if you are ever forced to go in again.

>This is basically a funny way to say that I'm going to teach you something you should avoid called Inheritance.
>Programmers who are currently in the forest battling the Queen will probably tell you that you have to go in.
>They say this because they need your help since what they've created is probably too much for them to handle.
>But you should always remember this:

>Most of the uses of inheritance can be simplified or replaced with composition,
>and multiple inheritance should be avoided at all costs.
